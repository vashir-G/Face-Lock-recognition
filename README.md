<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Libraries/Tools</h4>
<ol>
  <li>dlib (Version: 19.19.0)</li>

  <li>face-recognition</li>

  <li>flask</li>

  <li>cs50</li>

  <li>requests </li>

  <li>python version 3.8.10</li>
  </ol>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>So, first installed the libraries which are given above and for ease of the user I have also mentioned libraries requirements in “requirement.txt” you can simply look over that</li>

<li>I have used dlib 19.19.0 version, So, if you are facing difficulty in installing dlib so I will suggest to install it on python 3.8 </li>

<li>After installing the required libraries firstly run helpers.py so that they get executed once and after that just run Flask application.py it will run on localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000 then open it and use it. </li>
